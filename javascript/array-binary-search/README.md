# Binary search in a sorted 1D array

Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

- NOTE: The search algorithm used in your function should be a binary search.

## Approach & Efficiency

## Inputs / Outputs

## Algorithm

<!-- If we can find the length of the array, we can determine what the middle index value should be and push the new value into the array at that index.

- create a new empty array
- determine the middle of the array
- Use a for loop to look at all the elements in the array.(iterating through the array).
- Use an if statement to determine if [i] is at the middle index value
- if at middle value, push the new value to the new array
- if not at middle value, push the current value being iterated over -->

## Pseudocode

<!-- ```plaintext

function arrayInsert takes in `arr`:

  declare insertedArr = [];
  declare start <- 0;
  declare end <- length of arr minus 1;

  while start <= end:
    declare valueForInsert
    declare middleIndex value
    arr[current] != middleIndex ? insertedArr push valueForInsert : insertedArr push arr[current]

``` -->

## Actual Code

<!-- Not sure, but was under the imporession that this was not required? -->

## Visual
