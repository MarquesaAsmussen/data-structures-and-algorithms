# Reverse Array

<!-- Includes a function that takes in some array, and returns that an array with all the elements in reverse order. -->

## Inputs / Outputs

<!-- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`\
Output: `[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` -->

## Algorithm

<!-- If we can grab the ends of the array, we can just swap their values.

- Use a for loop to look at all the elements in the array.(iterating through the array).
- At each item, I swap with the inverse array index.
- Only go half way (give of take 1) and stop.
  - If we don't stop halfway we will re-swap. -->
